# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributor and maintainer of the murach-html5-css3 project, I pledge to respect everyone who contributes by posting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, and any other activities.

Communication inside the project must be constructive and never resort to personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

If any member of the community violates this code of conduct, I may take action, removing issues, comments, and PRs or blocking accounts as deemed appropriate.
